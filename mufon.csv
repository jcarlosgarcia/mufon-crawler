i thought at first. i did not know how to identify them, i was amazed, with my eyes wide opened and wishing they would pass by as soon as possible and they didnt  change their direction towards me. which they did not do, fortunately, although now i regret it. even so it took about 30 seconds to do 430 meters, which indicates a speed of 51 km / h. . i must admit that a great fear assaulted me, but even so i followed them closely until they vanished suddenly when reaching the top of the hill, only 3 meters of depression from the top to the bottom. ======================================================== dos monolitos negros de 3-4 metros de altura avanzando lenta y verticalmente en linea ayer, jueves santo, decidí acercarme a un camino rural  a 20 kms de sevilla, cerca de gerena, donde yo volaba aviones de aeromodelismo hace un tiempo. como había un tractor cogiendo agua del riachuelo que me bloqueaba  el paso, me fui a un camino que hay mas adelante. decidí dar un paseo, cogí mi silla-baston y ande 1600 metros y me paré para fumar un cigarrillo debajo de un macizo de cañas. el día era muy apacible, soplaba un poco de viento, y el cielo estaba despejado. eran las 20:15 horas y llevaría 10 minutos sentado cuando vi frente a mi, en la distancia, a poco menos de 500   metros, dos ""monolitos negros"" separados unos 50 metros entre si, que iban por el camino en sentido sur-norte.  iban despacio, por el suelo, verticalmente, como levitando, me quedé asombrado porque  aunque  estaban situados a 470 metros de mi (lo consulté después en google earth) estimé su altura en 3-4 metros. repito, iban despacio, a unos 50 km/h, lo cual es imposible con un coche por ese camino de tierra destrozado porque las rodadas de los tractores tras las recientes lluvias habían dejado unos surcos enormes.  sin embargo, ambos monolitos se desplazaban de manera uniforme, sin rectificar la dirección ni aminorar la velocidad. sinceramente, debían estar levitando sobre el camino o algo parecido, aunque la proximidad de un campo de trigo me impidió verlo claramente. se desplazaban de canto, presentando el plano mayor en mi dirección, eran de un tono negro satinado, es decir, ligeramente brillantes. su forma era de un paralelepípedo perfecto, cosa que recordaba mucho al monolito de la famosa película ""2001 una odisea en el espacio"". no es casualidad que el famoso astrónomo de la nasa carl sagan fuera quien aconsejó a stanley kubrik incluir el famoso monolito a raíz de unas extrañas observaciones realizadas desde la órbita lunar por los astronautas del apolo x en 1969. ¿qué demonios es eso?, pensé en un primer momento. no supe identificarlos, me quedé estupefacto, con los ojos abiertos como platos y deseando que pasarán de largo lo antes posible y no cambiaran de dirección hacia mi. cosa que no hicieron, afortunadamente, aunque ahora lo lamento. aún así tardaron unos 30 segundos en hacer 430 metros, lo que arroja una velocidad de 51 km/h. . he de reconocer que me asaltó un gran temor, pero aún así los segui atentamente hasta que se desvanecieron subitamente al alcanzar  la cima de la vaguada, de tan solo 3 metros de depresión.","37.541357","-6.173911599999999","ES-04072018-0012"

to use the bathroom and my dog was licking herself she was dripping piss just like i was and was licking herself  to hide the fact shortly after i started to feel stuff crawling on my head on my shoulders and back on my face shortly after i started having pain in my stomach like i was overly full  in my stomach felt heavy very very heavy  and it would get  very warm in my  penis region in my lower stomach  when i started to see  the entities  i realize what they were doing  they were  putting something in my stomach and the stomachs of my animals  and then taking it back out  every time i had to use the bathroom  i felt tingling sensation in my stomach and warmness  sometimes  when my stomach gets warm i get a sudden uncontrollable urge to piss i started hearing sounds and i realized using common sense that nothing was in there so  there should be  no sound so i started investigating and i would notice my animals would stare at something for a long time and then i started noticing subtle differences in the light very subtle differences in shadows i started filming all these incidences trying to see if i was going crazy because i would tell people and people would tell me i'm going crazy and i'm imagining stuff and for a while i thought i was but then i realized if i'm crazy then my dogs must be crazy sometimes i just realized today that a blue entity and a red entity and a blur entity follow me everywhere i go they followed me to my easter dinner at my uncle's my cousin's house on his easter dinner my mom's house today and the corner store several times they've even gone as far as to get into my mom's vehicle with me i started to call them out because it bothered me so much i started feeling like something was touching my ass and my butthole and i noticed when i close my eyes i would see shapes and figures shadowy figures i thought i was crazy but then i would notice that the figures would come close to my face and touch me in different areas at first i would react but then they notice that i could feel it and i would see them touching each other like on the shoulder and then pointing to me and shaking her head like a yes motion and the entire time i would be hearing a ringing in my ear or a humming this is still going on and i am tired of this very tired it is exhausting seeing these things constantly and constantly feeling them touch me everywhere even poked me in the eye balls it's never a violent poke it's just a touch but the blue one put his hand on my side left side and something in my body started hurting really bad like it was being pinched he did that because i filmed him and laughed at him and told him i did it because he keeps touching me and if he leaves me alone i want tell everybody he got angry because i called him a faggot for touching my butt and i seen him making angry face and he pushed me into a table and i split my nose it wasn't a violent push i just cut my nose then i felt a trembling feeling like i knew you was going to push me down the stairs and i'll pray to god and said don't be like that to him and he put his head down and turned around and walked away and he's never hurt me again but i still get a terrifying feeling when the big shadow comes and my couch shakes like in a motion like someone's having sex and like i said no i can see them when i close my eyes but they have ways of confusing you i don't know how they do it but they somehow have like multiple shadow people or blurs in one body and when they get spot it a bunch of them will pile up like one big blur and confuse you because you thought you saw a humanoid shape or a head or some glowing eyes and then a bunch of them appear or the shadow shape changes or a noise will come from behind you to get you to look

""i don't know,"" i replied. ""i landed on the dog.  was i floating above the bed?"" she replied that she didn't know as she reached for alex to comfort her. the next morning, i felt this discomfort in my ear which lasted about 4 1/2 weeks. once again it didn't hurt, it just felt like an ear ache that wouldn't go away. november 30, 2017 7:30am tucumcari, nm: i am a truck driver and i stopped at the loves travel center for the night. my younger daughter was riding with me. we got up in the morning, went in to take showers and get breakfast. we returned to the truck to eat our breakfast and as i began to say prayer for the food, i heard this beeping noise and stopped praying. i told my daughter, ""i think your watch is beeping."" she looked at her watch and said, ""no, my watch is on silent."" i told her that i could hear a beeping noise from somewhere in the truck. she stated that she didn't hear anything. i noticed that as i moved around the truck trying to find what was beeping, that the aspect to the sound never changed, nor the intensity of the noise. i told her, ""i think it's coming from my ear."" she had been getting over a cold, but still had a cough. she coughed kind of loud and my ear rang very loud. i jammed my finger in my ear while exclaiming, ""ahh!"" she asked what happened and i told her that when she coughed, it made my ear ring. i told her that when she was talking, it was making my ear ring also. it literally sounds like someone speaking into a microphone while standing too close to the speakers. we had a load to pick up in los lunas, nm going to walmart in el paso and then we were going to take a few days off. i told her that when we get to walmart, i was going to pick up some ear plugs because the ringing was bad. we made our delivery and went into the store to get ear plugs. as we were walking through the store, they announced something over the pa. my daughter was on my left side, and i grabbed my ear and bent down. my ear rang out really loud. my daughter asked, ""what happened?"" ""i don't know. when they got on the intercom, it made my ear ring."" she asked, ""is that what that noise was?"" ""what noise?"" i asked, not believing she could hear the noise from my ear. she mimicked the noise and i exclaimed, ""how can you hear what is going on in my ear?"" she replied, ""i don't know, but i heard it."" i told her that i needed to buy one of those scopes that the doctors use to look in my ear. she told me that walmart sells them over in the pharmacy section. we bought an otoscope, and when we got home she looked in my left ear and found a very shiny metallic object just above the eardrum attached to the ear canal with three legs on each side (picture to follow). i have shown this to many people and no one knows what it is. i am hesitant to see a doctor for fear that they may be required to report this. the beeping is constant (24 hours a day). it is driving me crazy and i have to carry ear plugs with me in case i go to a loud area and it begins to ring. i am looking for help to determine what this device is for and who put it there. i have more pictures, but this is the best one. i need a better otoscope with a dimmable light source, because the object is very reflective and washes out the image on my phone's camera.  any help would be appreciated. thank you.

i don't know if i was even pregnant for sure it was just a feeling and what i was screaming out to them in the middle of the night. i very quickly fell deep asleep and the next day i felt it was a horrible nightmare that my eyes where fully opened to see what i saw. but i knew very well this was a familiar feeling to me as in 1996 i had another similar experience with 2 small greys in the middle of the night when they temporarily paralyzed me and shoved something up my nose. at that time i thought it might have been a terrifying nightmare but over the years i was shown footage of abduction accounts and realized they were very similar to my own experience and began to realize that those experiences were as real as they felt. a couple days after this incident took place i had the intuition to check my body to see if there was any visible evidence from my experience. so just before i had a shower i had a look around my body and then i noticed an indentation on my mid back right side just along my spine. it felt like a hole in my back with a layer of skin on top. it was something very unusual and an unlikely thing to find on your back. i feel some discomfort from it and it feels like a wound as though it is in the process of healing. it's like a piece of tissue beside my spine has been taken. i feel a metallic feel around it and it's slightly sensitive when i move or twist my back. i asked my mother to take a picture of it as it is such an unusual thing to have on my body never seen before and it has a slight triangular red shape over the surface. i felt a lot of anger from this experience. that i did not agree or give my permission to do what ever it is they are doing. i had to learn to just let it go and to not allow fear or anger to over take me. i do feel some fear going to bed now and have noticed i am going to bed a lot later staying up until 2am. my partner is away a lot so i am sleeping alone most nights. i wonder if he had been there sleeping beside me if these beings would have come? i'm trying to have positive thoughts that maybe whatever these beings are doing to experiment with our dna or embryos is for some greater good. i really hope so anyways!! i have asked for a lot of protection around me. i have been fortunate to have had positive encounters with other ets and have seen dozens of ufo sightings. i've had other encounters and have picture's of markings from an encounter in march 17, 2011 of which i took a sample of and is in my freezer. this last experience was not at all good and i wonder if they truly were ets or government posing as ets? i'd love to go under hypnosis to know the truth. and for a doctor or specialists who is familiar with these type of extractions from the body to have a look at the indentation on my back. thanks for listening. i hope one day we will get more answers to what all these experiences mean.","44.50936308234465510606803206883341772481799125671386718750","-80.20170458687730765140860318297200137749314308166503906250","CA-04102018-0001"

it  then  would disappeared  in a blink of an eye and reappeared just as rapidly. it was followed  and mimickied  the entire time by organized translucent flashing lights ithat surrounded the biggest orb. as i said it was static and hovering but i got the sense  it was  piloted or guided by something intelligent  and looked extremely organized, working in unison together.  just like all the other times i have had ufo sightings i get the same weird unnerving vibe. i get instinctively creeped out but incredibly intrigued by what i am viewing. it sometimes puts me in a trancelike state more often than not. i guess i could describe the feeling as excitedly worried/anxious. regarding the question of when i lost sight of the objects, as i stated earlier in this write up;i have been wittiness to these sightings every night for the last year with a hiatus during the winter months of december, january, and february although there have been a few times during the hiatus that i managed to capture it when the clouds would break up. i would have to stay up till dawn to lose sight of it and have done so in the past watching the orbs slowly disappear while ascending up to the heavens. as for this particular sighting; i stopped watching it after about an hour and a half. it is essential i stop myself or i won’t sleep at all. it is hard to ignore it when it is sitting just outside above my street. however, i  have managed to resist watching the inimitable anomaly only through time and by  conducting different ways and methods  of watching without falling into the “zone”. for example: i  never stare at the orbs with the naked eye alone anymore. i view them through my iphone or nikon digital camera lens. staring at them with your own eyes can be a very powerful but incredibly strong feeling. it sweeps over your entire body and you feel incapable of stopping yourself from focusing on its wonderment. i am attracted  to it’s alluring aura and unworldly actions and origin. as for the evidence to back up my claim; i have enclosed all original  images and film taken with my iphone 6  just so that you know i am not making this up or trying to seek attention. i also sent  the enhanced exposure videos and stills so they are easier to see. three of the images are time stamped 11:37 pm and they show that the orbs change position in each frame. i used the  “burst” function on my iphone for multiple images of the orbs shot consecutively. i just want to be upfront about all of this before i am asked.  this is my first time ever reporting one of my incidents to an official investigative agency and i am still reluctant to do so. no offence to you guys but i do not seek nor do i need approval /confirmation by an agency of “official standards”. it is not my intention of filing a report solely so other imperfect people can speculate as to what these things are.  i am not doing this for official notoriety or i would have reported my first encounter of july 5th 2017 and everyone after that.    i  am filing a report because i believe it is our duty and obligation to make these events public for others to compare, study and observe so to better understand what these things might be and for the safety and or betterment of our species. i hope i am doing the right thing and i hope by doing the right thing we all gain a greater   perspective and knowledge. we can’t appreciate  the vastness of our universe and the reality of being part of a much bigger and grander scheme of things. i am hopeful that you will get some use of this info and i look foreword to hearing back from you soon. best regards, audrey williams ","45.3773647322944396420574264539027353748679161071777343750","-63.2961509012935379714370753845287254080176353454589843750","CA-04112018-0005"

( i personally have never seen lightening in a snow storm. but know its possible. i have seen a lot of snow storms living in northern canada. i asked my 12 year old, what exactly did you see? she was crying and holding on to me saying ""a bright blue light was at the window, then inside the house, everything turned blue then white. the candle flames got really big and then both cats ran out of the living room. just as she finished saying that, the room went bright from another window on the opposite side of the house. we all turned immediately towards that window, but the light was gone. again every one started panicking. i tried to calm them all and said to sit on the couch and ill get a fire going quick.  my wife stood in front of the big bay window, watching to see if it happened again.  i think about 10 minutes went by.  the fire was going, then my wife said, there it is again, out over the trees.  i stood up and got to the window to take a look.  i couldnt see a thing at first because the wind picked up causing everything to go dark outside.  she said she knew it was over the trees because the flash lit up the sky and the tree line.  all i could see was total darkness.  i dont know how long we stood there watching, but suddenly i snapped out of it and looked around.  my living room was filled with smoke.  i panicked and yelled for everyone to get to the back of the house.  the wife and kids went to the back door. i opened the wood stove door and messed around with the fire and told the wife to crack the back door to let the smoke out.  i remember distinctly feeling like this was all just a dream. nothing felt quite real. i had everything under control. after about 5 minutes with the door open the smoke was cleared. we all sat on the couch, trying to get warm.  the laptop had battery life in it so i put on a movie to watch while we waited for the hydro to come back on.  after calling the hydro company they told us that due to the storm, that it probably wouldn't be restored till 6pm tomorrow.  at the time, it didnt clue into my mind to try to film what was happening. all i was concerned with was protecting my family and keeping them safe. being a life long experiencer, i knew what was happening. about 6 months later i woke up in the middle of the night and remembered most of what happened. i would like to keep that between the investigator and myself.
